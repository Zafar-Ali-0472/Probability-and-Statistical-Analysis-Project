# Probability-and-Statistical-Analysis-Project

This project involves collecting data from 200 individuals and performing probability and statistical analysis on the given data. We applied various statistical methods to interpret the data, including probability distributions, confidence interval, measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion, etc.

## Features

- Data collection from 200 participants
- Detailed statistical analysis
- Confidence intervals
- Probability distributions
- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation)
